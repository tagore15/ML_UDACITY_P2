We found that training and testing time of Decision Tree algorithm is very low when compared to other algorithms like SVM, logistic regression. Although SVM has best generalized the model and has highest testing score, but its performance cost in terms of runtime is not as efficient as compared to decision tree. When compared to logistic regression, logistic regression are faster and have similar score as that of decision tree. We have chosen decision tree as it would be easier to interpret and explain. Also number of features are high and there is correlation between them which would limit logistic regression. Taking account of all these factors, we have chosen Decision Tree model to make prediction.
